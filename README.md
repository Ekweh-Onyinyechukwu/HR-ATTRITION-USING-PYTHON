 ## PROBLEM STATEMENT:




I am excited to announce that I have completed my first project during my internship at Merskill, and what an incredible journey it has been! This project focused on HR attrition analysis, and I had the opportunity to dive deep into the data using Python. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, and I am eager to share a bit about how I approached this project.

**Starting the Project:**

The project began with a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and other relevant factors. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights related to employee attrition.

**Steps I Took:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Imported the necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and contents of the data.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Checked for and handled any missing or inconsistent data to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.
   - Standardized categorical variables and ensured numerical data was properly formatted.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Utilized various EDA techniques to explore relationships between different variables and attrition.
   - Generated descriptive statistics to summarize key features of the data.
   - Created visualizations to better understand the distribution and trends within the dataset.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Conducted detailed analysis focusing on specific questions such as the impact of job satisfaction, years with the current manager, and other factors on attrition.
   - Employed statistical methods and visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns.

5. **Conclusion and Reporting:**
   - Compiled the findings and insights into a comprehensive report.
   - Presented the results using clear and impactful visualizations to convey the story behind the data.

Throughout this project, I leveraged the power of Python to perform data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The process was not only educational but also incredibly exciting as I got to see firsthand how data-driven decisions can be made in a corporate setting.

A huge thank you to the Merskill team for their support and guidance throughout this journey. I am looking forward to applying what I've learned to future projects and continuing to grow my skills in data analysis and Python programming.

Stay tuned for more updates on my internship experiences and projects!
